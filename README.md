<h1>Zus Coffee Order System</h1>
<h3>This project web application served as a practical exercise for a web development lab test when i was in Semester 3. This project is a simple web application for taking coffee orders at "Zus Coffee," allowing customers to provide their order information and receive an order summary. The application is developed using JavaServer Pages (JSP) and utilizes HTML and CSS for the user interface.</h3>

<h1>Features</h1>
<h3>Order Form: Customers can fill out an order form with the following information: </h3>
<ul><h4><li>Name</li>
<li>Phone Number</li> 
<li>Gender (Male or Female)</li>
<li>Quantity of different coffee types (Salted Caramel Latte, Cappuccino, Vanilla Latte, Cocoa Mocha)</li>
<li>Validation: Form fields are validated to ensure required fields are not empty, and quantity fields only accept positive integers.</li>
</ul></h4>

<h3>Order Summary: Upon submitting the order form, customers are redirected to an order summary page where they can view the details of their order, including: </h3>
<ul><h4><li>Name and contact information</li>
<li>Total quantity of drinks ordered</li>
<li>Total bill in RM (Malaysian Ringgit)</li>
</ul></h4>
